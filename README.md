Apps Inspector
===================
Apps Inspector detects frameworks used by your installed applications. Find out exactly what your apps are doing. Now you are able to know what advertising agencies or developers used in their app, and what tools they have integrated.

This is a simple Android application which detects other installed applications which appear to use known frameworks and offers the user the ability to easily uninstall them and view the info.

I'm looking for someone that willing to develop/give a fork for this app.

**To developer :** 
You are allow to download/view the source code and make any changes because this app still need alot of improvement and I'm not good in Java still. 

and also do let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.

NOTE : Yes, I'm aware of Addons Detector but this app will be open source and will have no airpush or advertisement in this app and also this app will be continue develop by you (the community) and improvement being made.
